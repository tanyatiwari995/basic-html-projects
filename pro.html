        <p><li><b>Having rejoined DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, which produced a number of successful missiles. Among them was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III; it was first launched in 1989. Another success was the surface-to-surface tactical missile Prithvi.</b></li></p>
        <p><li><b> During this period he played a key role in the government’s weaponization of missile systems, giving India nuclear capabilities. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed society to a developed one in 20 years. Among other measures, the plan called for increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and for widening access to health care and education.</b></li></p>

        <h2>Carrer : </h2>
        <p>Kalam was born in a town in Tamil Nadu state to a fishing boat owner from a once wealthy family. The youngest of five siblings, Kalam persevered with his education despite his impoverished circumstances. He earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. In 1980 SLV-III successfully released a satellite called Rohini into near-Earth orbit, taking India’s space program to the international stage. Kalam oversaw further development of launch vehicle technologies at ISRO, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.
